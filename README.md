## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset, compiled by the **United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network**, evaluates countries based on:

- GDP per capita
- Healthy life expectancy
- Social support
- Trust in government/business
- Freedom to make life choices

## üß† Analytics Workflow & Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
- Removed or imputed `NaN` values
- Checked for completeness using `.info()` and `.isnull()`
- Verified dataset quality before proceeding

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection and Engineering 
- Chose relevant features impacting happiness
- Created new variables (e.g., log GDP)
- Removed redundant columns

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensuring Data Integrity and Consistency
- Validated data types and corrected mismatches
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized formats and scales

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Summary Statistics and Insights
- Used `.describe()` to summarize data
- Highlighted key metrics and outliers
- Compared happiness scores regionally

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies 
- Analyzed correlation matrix and heatmaps
- Identified countries with anomalous scores
- Found trends among top and bottom performers

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Outliers and Data Transformations 
- Detected extreme values via Z-score and boxplots
- Normalized skewed data (e.g., log-transform)
- Improved data quality and model-readiness

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Visual Representation of Key Findings 
- Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for charts
- Presented bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms
- Visualized happiness by region, GDP, and trust
